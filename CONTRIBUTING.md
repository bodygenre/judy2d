# How to Contribute

Since Judy is a community tool, we want you be a part of the community if you are going to be using or extending it. Judy has super powerful permissions and we don't want malicious meanies abusing them vicariously.  With that in mind, we won't approve any of your PR's if we don't know who you are. You are free, however, to copy this code and adapt it for your own projects under the terms of the [LICENSE](LICENSE).

In order to join our community, click [this invite link](https://discord.gg/bfd4nWAAC6). Most of the discussions around code exist in [#coding-bardos](https://discord.com/channels/788925423420964904/979894864709824582) and test output from bots goes into [#bot-projects](https://discord.com/channels/788925423420964904/970747976794386432)(in case you need to spam a channel with output while you debug).

Once you get set up in the server and develop some rapport, you can ask to be added to the Github organization and get access to the bot token to develop on your local machine. If you want to create another totally separate bot, you can ask to be added to the Discord dev team. 

Come hang out, watch bad movies, and achieve samsara!
